# World-Happiness-report
This project analyzes global happiness trends from 2015–2019, highlighting India’s decline from rank 117 to 140. While global scores recover after 2017, India’s continue to fall due to weakening factors like income, health, and social support. The growing gap signals urgent need for improvement.
